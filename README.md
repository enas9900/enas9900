Interior design is the art and science
of enhancing the interior of a building
to achieve a healthier and more 
aesthetically pleasing environment for
the people using the space. With a keen
eye for detail and a creative flair, 
an interior designer is someone who 
plans, researches, coordinates, and
manages such enhancement projects.
Interior design is a multifaceted
profession that includes conceptual
development, space planning, site 
inspections, programming, research, 
communicating with the stakeholders 
of a project, construction management, 
and execution of the design.
